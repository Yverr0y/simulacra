"""RPA-on-air presence check - attacker's-eye confirmation for the churn_adv raw-HCI fix.

Milestone A's headline decoy is the "privacy phone": a device advertising with a
Resolvable-Private-Address subtype (top-2-bits 01 / 0x40) that rotates. NimBLE's
`ble_gap_ext_adv_set_addr` REJECTS that subtype, so before the churn_adv raw-HCI fix
the decoy fleet emitted ZERO RPA-shaped addresses on air (a third of the roster was
silently dark). This script confirms, from a real BLE capture, that RPA-shaped
addresses are now actually transmitting.

Usage:
    python rpa_presence.py <capture.pcap> [min_rpa_advertisers]
    # default floor = 3 distinct RPA advertisers

It reuses capture_profile.py's parser (DLT256 + Nordic DLT157 aware) and counts
DISTINCT advertisers by address subtype. Exits non-zero if fewer than the floor of
RPA advertisers are present.

HONEST SCOPE: this counts ALL RPA advertisers in range - ambient real phones emit
RPA too, so a nonzero count is not by itself proof the DECOYS are emitting it. The
decisive signal is before-vs-after: with the fleet running, decoys were contributing
zero RPA before the fix; a healthy RPA count now (especially of short-lived, churning
advertisers co-located with the fleet) is the confirmation. For strict decoy
isolation, cross-reference strong-RSSI / co-located advertisers or decoy archetypes.
This script does NOT measure the physical layer (RSSI/AoA) - consistent with the
spec's honest ceiling, on-air RPA presence raises cost, it is not invisibility.
