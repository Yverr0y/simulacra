# Roadmap

> **Project:** **Simulacra** - a fork of [Splinter](https://github.com/0xXyc/splinter) by 0xXyc (Jacob Swiz), used with permission.
>
> A BLE/RF **anti-tracking decoy**: generate a synthetic population of plausible-but-fake
> wireless devices that statistically matches the local RF environment but corresponds to
> **no real device**, so your real devices stop standing out in the crowd.

Each milestone must leave a **flashable, working device** - we extend the horizon, we don't
break what works.

## Design laws (every milestone respects these)

1. **Aggregates only** - store distributions/templates, never per-device identifiers. Hash or
   drop real MACs, names, and payloads at capture time.
2. **No verbatim replay** - synthesize new identities; never re-broadcast a captured real one.
3. **Non-connectable only** - broadcast-only; never the Apple/Microsoft/Google pairing-popup
   payload formats.
4. **Population-match** - the active fakes never far exceed the observed real device density.
5. **No raw capture in shipping builds** - raw dumps live behind a compile-time debug flag.

## Phase 1 - Foundation ✅ (M3 - done, hardware-verified on ESP32-C6)

- Identity pool (256 synthetic identities) + churn engine: an active set of ~8, each on-air for
  minutes (dwell), then a 30–60 min cooldown, then **reappears with the same MAC**.
- 4 concurrent extended-advertising instances; the active set is time-sliced across them.
- Vendor templates (company ID + optional name) with tunable probabilities.
- On-target self-test asserting the invariants (e.g. no identity reappears before cooldown).

## Phase 2 - Realism (M4–M6)

- **M4 - Per-vendor payload templates.** Structurally-valid payloads (iBeacon/Tile/fitness-band
  shaped); vendor + interval + payload sampled **jointly** so no impossible combinations occur.
- **M5 - Observe → model.** Passive BLE scan + Wi-Fi promiscuous capture; extract **features
  only**; hash-and-drop identifiers immediately; aggregate into a distribution model of the
  local environment. (Data-discipline laws bite hardest here.)
- **M6 - Generate from model + population-match.** Roster drawn from the live model (vendor mix,
  intervals, payloads); active-set size driven by observed device density; re-profile on cadence.

## Phase 3 - Multi-signal & power (M7–M8)

- **M7 - Wi-Fi probe injection.** Randomized-MAC probe-request frames mimicking real phone scanning.
- **M8 - Coexistence & duty-cycle.** BLE advertise + BLE/Wi-Fi scan + Wi-Fi probe share the one
  2.4 GHz radio without starving; battery-aware (e.g. don't re-profile while stationary); runs for
  days on a LiPo.

## Phase 4 - Hardening / anti-correlation (M9+, the moonshot)

*Aimed at fingerprinting + multi-modal correlation systems (e.g. ALPR-linked RF harvesting such as
Leonardo ELSAG SignalTrace). Long-horizon and exploratory - but each step still ships a working
device. These specifically target the two layers a simple decoy can't beat: **RF fingerprinting**
and **cross-modal correlation**.*

- **M9 - The Coven (multi-node mesh).** Several coordinated nodes with **heterogeneous hardware**
  so the decoys carry genuinely distinct hardware RF fingerprints *and*
  spatial / independent-motion diversity a single emitter physically cannot fake. The single
  biggest hardening - one radio can't forge N fingerprints; many radios can.
- **M10 - Cross-protocol personas.** Bind a BLE identity + a Wi-Fi identity (later sub-GHz) into
  one synthetic "device" that emits consistently across protocols and appears/leaves together -
  defeating correlators that filter BLE-only ghosts. **Same-board v1 done 2026-07-16
  (`feat/cross-protocol-personas`, firmware compile-verified esp32c5+esp32c6). **Mesh-distributed
  personas landed 2026-07-17** (`-DSIMULACRA_FLEET_SIZE=K`): each node runs `1/K` of the population,
  so *whole personas are distributed across physically separated nodes* (each persona keeps its two
  radios co-located, as a real phone does, but different personas originate from different points) -
  spatial diversity of the *crowd*. The audit measures the win and it is **modest on real data**:
  modeled RSSI separability falls K=1 **0.15** → K=2 **0.14** → K=3 **0.12** (`scorecard.py
  --fleet-curve`), because the per-identity TX-power dither already closes most of the co-location
  tell - the larger mesh benefit is `K` distinct RF fingerprints, which this axis does not measure.
  Note: splitting a single persona's two radios across nodes would be wrong - it manufactures a
  "phone whose radios are metres apart" tell no real device has; the fix is crowd spatial diversity,
  not the pair.**
- **M11 - Targeted mimicry (mimic ring).** Detect your own device(s) and generate decoys that
  clone their vendor/type, so your real device is one of many identical signatures instead of a
  unique one co-occurring with you.
- **M12 - Sub-GHz / TPMS dimension.** A CC1101 add-on to flood decoy tire-pressure-sensor IDs -
  attacking a per-vehicle anchor that BLE/Wi-Fi noise can't touch. (Sub-GHz TX has its own
  regulatory weight; keep it low-power and deliberate.)
- **M13 - Counter-surveillance scry.** Turn the sensing inward-out: detect active RF collection
  (probe/scan-request emitters, collector signatures) and alert / adapt duty-cycle.

## Honest ceilings (design around these - never overpromise)

- **Additive only.** It can't silence your real device. The strongest posture is Simulacra **+
  emission hygiene** (radios off / airplane mode / Faraday in transit; devices with good MAC *and*
  timing randomization; ditch always-on wearables).
- **Can't touch non-RF / legal anchors** - a license plate, cellular identity.
- **One radio can't forge N hardware fingerprints** - which is exactly why the Coven matters.
  *The detectability audit now measures this physical (RSSI) tell directly (**done 2026-07-17**):
  modeled single-node decoy RSSI is only ~0.15 separable from a real crowd - the per-identity
  TX-power dither mitigates it well - but the ceiling stands; only spatially separated nodes (M9)
  truly beat it. This closes the audit's last discriminator axis (address / interval / vendor /
  AD-structure / presence / RSSI all done). Mesh v2 (`-DSIMULACRA_FLEET_SIZE=K`) now distributes the
  crowd across K nodes and the audit confirms it lowers the modeled separability (0.15 → ~0.12 at
  K=3) - but the honest ceiling stands: **K nodes give K points, not one-per-device; the win is
  proportional to node count**, and modest here because the dither already did most of the work.*
- **Decoys, not jamming.** Jamming and cellular spoofing are illegal and a different (worse) project.
- **Realistic claim, even maxed out:** *raises the cost of and degrades automated / mass RF
  correlation - especially as a heterogeneous multi-node mesh - not a guarantee against a targeted,
  fingerprinting-grade adversary.*

## Hardware status

- **In-hand fleet:** ESP32-**C5** (dual-band Wi-Fi 6) ×2, SparkFun Thing Plus ESP32-**C6**
  (onboard charging + MAX17048 fuel gauge) ×1, and an ESP32 "Cheap Yellow Display" (**Vigil**) ×1.
- **Firmware builds + HW-validated:** **C6** (✅ verified) and **C5** (✅ HW-validated - extended
  advertising works; builds with `--preview`).
- **Multi-node note:** the fleet can be physically separated for mesh work, but only one node is
  USB-tethered (flash + serial) at a time; a second runs headless on a powerbank, with Vigil as an
  always-on ESP-NOW observation point.
