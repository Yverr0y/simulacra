# Directed-Probe SSID Realism — Design

**Date:** 2026-07-22
**Status:** Approved (design), pending implementation plan
**Roadmap:** Phase 3/4 — Wi-Fi probe realism (cross-protocol personas follow-up)

## Goal

Make a realistic minority of decoy probe agents probe for **named** SSIDs (not only the wildcard
broadcast probe), so the fake-phone crowd matches the measured real-crowd behavior and blends into
the same networks real phones are already probing everywhere. Today every decoy agent probes
wildcard-only, 100% of the time (`main/probe_frame.c`: every archetype tail begins with a wildcard
SSID element `0x00,0x00`).

## Motivation — measured, not assumed

An earlier session banked this idea but flagged it as possibly-not-worth-it ("modern phones are
mostly wildcard anyway"). This session's gate-check **disproved that assumption with real data.**
`tools/probe_audit/analyzers/kismet_behavior.py::reference_profile` measured `wildcard_fraction`
across three real Kismet captures with decreasing decoy contamination:

| Capture | decoy contamination | measured real wildcard_fraction |
|---|---|---|
| `Kismetscannew` | heavy (fixed-16 fleet) | 0.84 |
| `718scan` | mixed-firmware | 0.81 |
| `newest` | cleanest (post-fix fleet) | **0.36** |

The trend is diagnostic: our always-wildcard decoys *inflate* the measured wildcard fraction, so the
cleanest capture (fewest residual decoys) is the most trustworthy read of the true real crowd —
**~0.36 wildcard**, i.e. **~64% of real devices probe at least one named SSID.** Decoys sit at 1.0.
That is a large, real behavioral gap, directly measurable on the `wildcard_fraction` audit axis.

**Calibration anchor (honest caveat):** 0.36 is one location/capture; treat it as an evidence-based
anchor to aim near (target decoy wildcard fraction ~0.36–0.45), not a universal constant. Landing in
that band — versus the current 1.0 — is the success criterion, not hitting a specific decimal.

## Safety invariants (the part that must not be gotten wrong)

1. **Never draw an SSID from anything locally observed.** The pool is a fixed, compiled-in, curated
   list of generic/common **public** network names only. The on-device `observe`/`learn` pipeline
   (which sees the user's *actual* nearby/known networks) is **never** a source. Probing for a real
   local SSID would announce the user's actual location/associations, or be indistinguishable from
   genuinely being on that network — the exact deanonymization this whole project exists to prevent.
   This is a hard, tested invariant.
2. **Per-persona independent draw — no shared PNL constellation.** Each persona independently draws
   its own small random subset of the pool. The design explicitly does **not** assign one shared
   SSID list to a node's whole population (that recreates a per-node shared-PNL fingerprint — the
   exact constellation tell removed elsewhere) and does **not** enforce node-to-node SSID uniqueness
   (real common SSIDs like retail captive portals are probed by *many* devices at once; forcing
   uniqueness is itself unrealistic). Popular pool entries naturally recur across personas =
   realistic overlap, which is correct, not a leak.
3. **Law-3 is unaffected and does not need extending.** Verified against `components/simulacra_radar/
   law3.c`: Law-3 is BLE-manufacturer-data-specific (it scans for the Apple Continuity/Find-My
   subtype bytes after the `4C 00` company prefix). A Wi-Fi probe request triggers no pairing UI on
   any device regardless of SSID — directed SSID probing is a *different, simpler* safety property
   (invariant #1 above), not a Law-3 case. No Law-3 code changes.

## Architecture

Three small, well-bounded units.

### 1. SSID pool — `main/ssid_pool.{h,c}` (new, pure, host-testable)

A fixed compiled-in table of generic/common public SSID strings with per-entry weights (popular
names weighted higher so they recur realistically). Pure accessors only:

```c
#define SSID_POOL_MAX_LEN 32   // 802.11 SSID element max
int         ssid_pool_count(void);
const char *ssid_pool_at(int i, uint8_t *len_out);   // NUL-terminated name + its byte length
int         ssid_pool_pick_weighted(void);           // weighted random index (esp_random)
```

Curation principle (documented in the header): entries are names that appear in a very large number
of real devices' preferred-network lists across many locations — ubiquitous captive-portal / carrier
/ default-router names — so a directed probe for one is indistinguishable from the real background
and reveals nothing about *this* user. No brand-owned proprietary identifiers that could imply a
specific private network. Exact list finalized in the plan; it is data, trivially editable later.

### 2. Per-persona SSID assignment — `main/probe_agents.{h,c}`

`probe_agent_t` gains a tiny fixed-size assigned set (pool indices, not raw bytes — an index into
the trusted pool cannot smuggle arbitrary/observed bytes):

```c
#define AGENT_SSID_MAX 3
uint8_t ssid_n;                 // 0 = permanently wildcard-only (this persona has no named nets)
uint8_t ssid_idx[AGENT_SSID_MAX];
```

> **SUPERSEDED 2026-08-26 — see "Revision: SSID sets are redrawn on MAC rotation" below.** The
> paragraph that follows describes the original rule, kept for the record. Two things in it are no
> longer true: the set is redrawn on every MAC rotation, and the calibration is `0.21`, not `0.62`.

Assigned **once per persona life**, in `agent_spawn` and `probe_agent_sync` (the two identity-birth
sites), NOT on intra-life MAC rotation — a real phone's saved-network list is a property of the
*device/session*, not of a MAC rotation. With probability `~0.62` (the calibration target) a persona
draws 1–3 distinct pool entries via `ssid_pool_pick_weighted`; otherwise `ssid_n = 0` (stays
wildcard for its whole life). This split is what moves the aggregate wildcard fraction from 1.0 to
~0.38.

**Per-burst choice.** When a persona *has* an assigned set, each individual probe burst still
independently chooses wildcard vs. one of its own assigned names (real phones interleave both within
a scan cycle). The exact per-burst wildcard probability is chosen so the *device-level* wildcard
fraction the audit measures lands in the target band — the plan derives it from the persona-level
0.62 and validates empirically, since the audit measures per-device (per-MAC) wildcard status.

### 3. Frame builder — `main/probe_frame.c`

`probe_build_request` currently `memcpy`s the whole archetype tail, whose first 2 bytes are the
hardcoded wildcard SSID element. Change the signature to accept an optional SSID:

```c
int probe_build_request(const uint8_t mac[6], uint8_t ch, probe_arch_t arch, bool band5,
                        const char *ssid, uint8_t ssid_len,   // NULL/0 -> wildcard (unchanged)
                        uint8_t *out, size_t *out_len);
```

Compose in two pieces instead of one blind copy: emit the SSID element ourselves
(`0x00, ssid_len, <bytes>` for directed, or `0x00, 0x00` for wildcard), then copy the archetype tail
**from offset 2 onward** (everything after its placeholder wildcard element) unchanged. **When
`ssid==NULL`, the output is byte-identical to today** — zero risk to the existing archetype
fingerprints the `probe_audit` byte-exact tests pin. Guard the frame length: `24 + 2 + ssid_len +
(tail_len - 2) <= PROBE_FRAME_MAX`; pool entries are short (≤ ~15 chars) so this never trips, but the
bound is checked and returns the existing error path if it ever would.

Caller (the live probe injector in `main/probe.c`) resolves the due agent's per-burst SSID choice and
passes it through.

## Data flow (per probe burst)

1. Persona/agent is born (`agent_spawn` / `probe_agent_sync`) → with ~0.62 probability it draws 1–3
   pool SSID indices into `ssid_idx[]`; else `ssid_n = 0`.
2. A burst comes due → if `ssid_n > 0`, roll per-burst wildcard-vs-named; if named, pick one of the
   agent's own `ssid_idx[]` and resolve it via `ssid_pool_at`.
3. `probe_build_request(..., ssid, ssid_len, ...)` emits the frame (wildcard path byte-identical to
   today).

## Testing (host, `tools/probe_audit` — all existing infrastructure)

- **`ssid_pool` (pure):** `ssid_pool_count > 0`; every entry `≤ SSID_POOL_MAX_LEN` and non-empty;
  `ssid_pool_pick_weighted` returns valid indices and (over many draws) favors higher-weighted
  entries; **invariant test:** the pool contains only the compiled-in strings (a structural test that
  the pool has no path to `observe`/`learn` — the module includes nothing from that pipeline).
- **`probe_frame` byte-exactness:** with `ssid=NULL`, `probe_build_request` output is byte-for-byte
  identical to the pre-change build for every archetype/band (extend the existing byte-exact
  fixtures — this is the safety net for "wildcard path unchanged"). With a directed SSID, the emitted
  SSID element is `0x00,len,<bytes>` and the rest of the body matches the wildcard body from offset 2
  on; total length within `PROBE_FRAME_MAX`.
- **`probe_agents` assignment:** over many spawns, ~21% of agents get `ssid_n > 0` (assert a band,
  e.g. 0.14–0.29, not an exact fraction); assigned indices are valid and distinct; assignment is
  **re-drawn on every MAC rotation** as well as on reincarnation. *(Revised 2026-08-26: this bullet
  previously required the set to be stable across an intra-life MAC rotation, and the band was
  0.5–0.75.)*
- **End-to-end via `probe_behavior_scorecard.py`:** a new `probe_dump` mode dumps per-agent
  wildcard-vs-named burst behavior over a window; feed it through the existing `wildcard_fraction`
  axis and confirm the modeled decoy wildcard fraction drops from 1.0 into the target band
  (~0.72–0.86 after the 2026-08-26 recalibration; originally ~0.36–0.45). This is the headline
  verification the whole feature exists for.

## Scope check

Considered splitting "pool curation" from "draw mechanism" into two specs. Rejected — the pool is
~30 lines of static data with trivial pure accessors; it is not an independent subsystem, and the
draw mechanism is meaningless without it. One spec, three tightly-coupled files, one plan. The pool
*contents* are data and freely editable later without re-design.

## Out of scope

- Per-band or per-archetype SSID differentiation (e.g. Apple vs Android probing different network
  sets) — no evidence it matters; YAGNI. All personas draw from one pool.
- Directed probes on the BLE side — N/A (BLE has no SSID concept).
- Sourcing SSIDs from observed traffic — explicitly forbidden (safety invariant #1), never in scope.
- Tuning the pool to a *specific* capture's SSID distribution — the pool is generic-by-design; we
  match the wildcard *fraction*, not a particular location's network names.

## Revision: SSID sets are redrawn on MAC rotation (2026-08-26)

The original spec assigned a persona's saved-network set **once per life** and deliberately carried
it across intra-life MAC rotations, reasoning that a real phone's saved-network list belongs to the
device, not to a MAC. That reasoning is sound as realism and was implemented and tested as specified.

It is reversed here, under the project-wide rule that no identifier this project emits may survive a
rotation. A saved-network set that outlives a MAC rotation *is* a persistent identifier, and a
potent one: probing for the same set from two MACs is the standard way MAC randomisation gets
defeated in the field. It sat in the same category as the long-lived static BLE band and
`BLE_ROLE_PERSISTENT` — deliberate, documented, realism-motivated, and a tracking handle — and it
goes the same way.

**Why the realism cost is near zero, and why that does not generalise.** The property being given up
— "a device keeps its saved networks across a rotation" — is observable *only* to someone who has
already linked the two MACs, and the SSID set is precisely what performs that linking. Remove it and
there is no vantage point from which the change can be seen. The tell erases itself. Most realism
trades are not like this; this one is, which is what makes it cheap rather than merely worthwhile.

**Residual, known and accepted.** Aggregate SSID-to-MAC multiplicity does remain observable without
per-device attribution. A real crowd shows a given SSID probed by several distinct MACs over an
hour; redrawing on every rotation pushes the fleet toward one MAC per SSID. The 38-entry pool blunts
this — with far more personas than pool entries, collisions arise naturally — but does not remove
it. If this axis is ever measured and found wanting, the fix is pool sizing, not restoring
carry-over.

**Calibration also changed** (independently of the above). `SSID_ASSIGN_PCT` moved 62 → 21,
`SSID_BURST_NAMED_PCT` 60 → 78, and distinct names per naming device ~2 → ~1.05, all from a census
of real probing devices. Real devices split sharply into "never names" and "names almost every
burst", and a namer typically has exactly one network it is looking for; the original values
modelled the middle of that distribution, a shape no real crowd exhibits. Aggregate directed share
lands ~16.5% against a measured 27.1%, because real naming devices are also ~2x chattier overall
(4.14 probes each vs 2.11). That is a burst-frequency knob, not an SSID knob, and is left alone
rather than fudged by inflating one of the three measured parameters.

**Tests changed:** `test_assignment_stable_across_mac_rotation` →
`test_assignment_redrawn_on_mac_rotation` (asserts the inverse property);
`test_assignment_fraction_near_calibration` and `test_decoy_wildcard_fraction_in_target_band` rebanded
to the censused anchors.
