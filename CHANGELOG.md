# Changelog

Newest first. Forward-looking milestones live in [`docs/ROADMAP.md`](docs/ROADMAP.md). The README's
own "Recent updates" section keeps only the latest few entries - this is the full history.

- **Additive fleet population + AUTO/MANUAL modes.** Decoys used to run `1/K` of one fleet-wide
  crowd, so adding a board redistributed cover instead of adding it. That division was introduced to
  fix a real measured problem (three boards once put 88 synthetic devices into a room holding 4-9
  real ones), but it was justified partly on spatial diversity the boards never get in practice -
  they travel together in one bag. Each board now sizes its own crowd from the ambient density it
  measures, and boards add up. The preset ladder is replaced by two orthogonal modes: **AUTO**
  tracks the room and honours an operator-set cap; **MANUAL** LOW/MED/HIGH pins a fixed fraction of
  each board's capacity. This also retires the STEALTH/NORMAL pair, which resolved to identical
  settings on the C5 and could not be told apart on the console. CONFIG wire goes to v2 (the preset
  ordinals changed meaning, so a mixed-firmware fleet now fails loudly instead of silently applying
  the wrong preset) - **flash every board together.** Hardware-verified on the 3-node fleet.
- **Project wiki.** A full [CYD console guide + reference](https://github.com/Em3ritus/simulacra/wiki)
  (every screen, setting, preset, and status word explained) and a project-wide glossary, published
  and linked from the README.
- **TURBO flood mode.** A sixth console preset for field use, not realism: trigger it fleet-wide
  (two-tap confirm) and every board independently maxes its own BLE + Wi-Fi churn - no room-density
  matching, no persona coupling - burning through as much identifier space as the hardware sustains.
  The idea, and the framing that population-matching optimizes for *not being flagged* while TURBO
  optimizes for *processing cost*, came out of a DEFCON conversation. Ships in main and the public
  web-flasher build. Hardware-verified at both full 3-node-fleet and single-standalone-board (K=1)
  scale with zero radio TX errors.
- **Vigil console, fully fleshed out.** The touch dashboard became a real operator console: tap a
  node card for a **per-node telemetry page**; tap a follower for a **per-threat detail card**
  surfacing the fields the decoys already report (device class, match confidence, vendor company-id,
  epochs, first/last-seen span); a two-page **INFO** system/fleet console with a colour/posture
  **legend**; **live-vs-pending preset** state (each decoy now reports the preset it is *actually*
  running, so the console flags a `MIXED` fleet); and a signed, two-tap **CLEAR THREATS** control
  that wipes the fleet's detection history from the panel.
- **Browser web-flasher - [live](https://em3ritus.github.io/simulacra/).** Flash a starter fleet
  from a web page - ESP Web Tools over Web Serial, auto-detecting the board and installing the right
  role. A CI action builds the three firmwares and deploys the flasher to GitHub Pages on every
  firmware change, so no binaries ever live in git.
- **Protection posture + dashboard cleanup.** The Vigil now leads with one honest word for your
  current state (`CLOAKED` / `EXPOSED` / `HUNTED` / `DARK`), and the data pages were reorganized into
  grouped, aligned sections.
- **Wi-Fi crowd realism.** Probe agents now match the ambient device density (divided across the live
  fleet) and a realistic majority probe **named public networks** from a fixed pool - never an
  observed SSID - closing the "everyone's a wildcard" behavioural tell.
- **Cross-protocol personas (M10 v1).** BLE and Wi-Fi identities are now bound into single,
  co-present synthetic devices that appear and leave together - so a correlator can't isolate your
  real dual-radio phone by filtering out single-radio "ghosts." Persona BLE identities present a
  realistic, Law-3-safe phone shape (terse flags-only / 16-bit service-UUID adverts on rotating
  RPAs), never vendor-matched accessory beacons.
- **Detectability, measured across every axis.** The host audit compiles the real generator *and*
  the real self-learning path, then scores separability from a real capture on address-type mix,
  advertising interval, vendor histogram, AD structure, and presence/lifespan - turning "are the
  decoys convincing?" into a single regression-gate number. Recent passes closed several structural
  tells (AD-structure monoculture, a bogus presence metric) and added a static-infrastructure cohort.
- **Presence & lifespan realism.** Decoys now include persistent static-infrastructure devices and
  per-type address rotation alongside the death/rebirth churn, so the population's come-and-go
  behaviour matches a real crowd instead of a fixed set.
- **Vigil console (CYD).** Live radar/threat dashboard reskinned, plain-language labels, responsive
  touch control, and a per-node fleet roster surfacing TX-health and battery state.
- **Post-flash sequence gate.** A two-board bench check confirms each fake phone keeps an
  independent 802.11 sequence counter after an IDF/toolchain bump.
