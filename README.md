**A modular, multi-node ESP32 anti-tracking system.** Simulacra continuously fabricates a
churning crowd of plausible-but-fake wireless devices around you - drowning your real devices in
noise so that passive trackers, ALPR add-ons, and co-travel correlators can't reliably pick your
signal out of the crowd - while passively watching for the trackers that follow you.

It is built from cooperating nodes, each playing to a different board's strengths, coordinated
over an encrypted ESP-NOW link.

## ⚠️ Legal & responsible use

Simulacra is a research and personal-privacy tool. It transmits synthetic BLE/Wi-Fi advertising
traffic and observes the RF around you. **You are responsible for complying with the radio
regulations and laws in your jurisdiction.** Do not use it to harass, impersonate a specific
person or device, interfere with networks or emergency services, or evade lawful process. Use it
on hardware you own, in ways that are legal where you are. No warranty; see the license.

**TURBO is not a DoS mode.** It's still in-spec, non-connectable BLE advertising and standard
802.11 probe requests at legal power - no deauth, no jamming, no malformed frames. A handful of
ESP32 boards cannot meaningfully deny service to nearby real networks or clients; what it does is
raise the volume of traffic someone has to process. The same rules above apply to it.

---

## How it works

- **A churning synthetic crowd.** Instead of hiding a device, Simulacra hides it *in a crowd* -
  generating a rotating population of realistic fake devices (random-static MACs, plausible
  vendor/format shapes, realistic advertising cadence) that constantly turns over.
- **Structure, never identity.** The self-learning engine harvests the *shape* of real nearby
  device adverts (vendor/format/AD structure) and turns them into new decoy archetypes - but it
  strips all identifying content. A learned template is "a device *of this kind*", never "*this
  device*". A hard "Law-3" gate refuses to ever learn or emit forbidden identity subtypes
  (e.g. Apple continuity / Fast Pair pairing beacons).
- **Passive detection.** While it churns, it watches for followers - devices that persist with you
  - and matches adverts against a signature database of known trackers (AirTag / SmartTag / Tile)
  and surveillance gear.
- **Coordinated, not cloned.** Nodes share a learned library and exclude each other from their own
  models over an authenticated ESP-NOW link, so the fleet behaves like one diverse crowd rather
  than several identical decoys.

## Architecture - the nodes

| Node | Board | Role |
|------|-------|------|
| **Ward** | ESP32-C5 (dual-band Wi-Fi 6) | Fixed / vehicle decoy - dense, dual-band crowd generation |
| **Shade** | ESP32-C6 | Mobile / everyday-carry decoy - lean, 2.4 GHz, low-profile |
| **Vigil** | ESP32 + "Cheap Yellow Display" | Controller & librarian - radar/status screen, touch control, encrypted SD library, fleet key custody |

Roles are selected at build time so one firmware tree serves every board. **ESP32-C5 (Ward) is the
suggested board to start with** - dual-band, and it takes and charges its own battery - so a
minimal build is one C5 + one Vigil. ESP32-C6 (Shade) remains fully supported for anyone who wants
the lower-power/everyday-carry variant.

## Features

- Rotating BLE decoy crowd with realistic random-static MACs, vendor/format shapes, and advertising
  cadence - including **persistent devices with per-type address rotation** (RPAs/NRPAs rotate on
  realistic schedules, static beacons hold) and a **death/rebirth lifecycle**, so the population
  turns over like a real crowd instead of a fixed set of decoys.
- **Wi-Fi PAN cover:** independent, archetype-faithful probe-request agents (iPhone / Galaxy /
  Pixel / generic Android). Each fake phone carries its **own 802.11 sequence counter**, so the
  real device can't be fingerprinted out of the probe traffic by its sequence/timing constellation.
  The agent population **matches the ambient device density** (divided across the live fleet so the
  crowd never over-populates an empty room), and a realistic majority **probe named public networks**
  - drawn from a fixed pool of ubiquitous open SSIDs (xfinitywifi, attwifi, eduroam …), **never an
  observed or local one** - so the fake phones blend with the real phones probing the same hotspots.
- On-device **self-learning** of ambient device *shapes* into new decoy archetypes (structure-only,
  Law-3 gated), synced across the fleet and persisted to an AES-GCM-sealed SD library on Vigil, keyed
  from the CONTROL secret in the provisioned regime (`-DSIMULACRA_FLEET_PROVISION=1` - rotates
  automatically with `tools/gen_ctrl_key.py`). The baked-key demo regime still keys it from a
  published, non-secret placeholder constant - an accepted tradeoff for that regime, matching its
  documented "shared key, not private" posture elsewhere.
- **Passive follower detection** and **tracker/surveillance fingerprint** matching.
- **Signed fleet control:** Vigil pushes Ed25519-signed behaviour presets to every decoy over
  ESP-NOW, in two modes. **AUTO** sizes each board's crowd from the ambient device density it
  measures, so the fleet matches the room it's actually in; an operator-set cap bounds how far it
  can scale. **MANUAL** (LOW / MED / HIGH) pins a fixed fraction of each board's capacity and
  ignores the room. The console shows which preset the fleet is **actually running** (live vs.
  pending), plus a signed one-tap **clear-threats** command that wipes every decoy's stale detection
  history from the panel. **TURBO** is a field-use flood mode, not a realism mode: every board
  independently maxes its own BLE and Wi-Fi churn - no room-density matching - to raise the
  processing cost of whoever's watching. Manual-only, two-tap confirm, sticky until changed.
- **Boards are additive.** Each decoy sizes its own crowd independently, so adding a board adds
  cover rather than redistributing it, while AUTO's density matching keeps the *fleet* honest in a
  sparse room. Every board also carries its own set of hardware advertising slots, which is the real
  limit on how fast fresh identities reach the air.
- **On-air fleet enrollment (ECDH):** decoys ship with no shared transport key and enroll on-air via
  a mutually-authenticated 3-message handshake, so **a captured decoy can't forge commands or
  impersonate the Vigil to other decoys.** It does end up holding the same shared fleet transport key
  as every other member, though - see Security model below for what that key protects and doesn't.
- **Vigil console:** an at-a-glance **protection posture** - one honest word for your current state
  (`CLOAKED` / `EXPOSED` when there's no crowd to hide in / `HUNTED` when a follower is confirmed /
  `DARK`) - plus a live radar/threat display, grouped status pages, a per-node fleet roster, and
  enroll/revoke control for fleet members. Tap in for depth: a **per-node telemetry console**, a
  **per-threat detail card** (device class, confidence, vendor, persistence), a two-page **system
  console + colour legend**, and signed fleet control - all from the touch panel, no laptop.
- **Fleet health at a glance:** decoys report TX self-health and battery state over the link, so
  Vigil surfaces a `DEGRADED` or `LOW BATT` node on its roster before it goes quiet in the field.

## Security model

- **Asymmetric by design.** The controller (Vigil) holds the private signing key; decoys hold only
  the public key. A captured decoy can verify commands but cannot forge them or control the fleet.
- **Never trust the wire.** Every synced/seeded template is re-gated (budget + Law-3 + hash recompute)
  on receipt, so a leaked key or spoofed node still cannot inject a forbidden identity.
- **The fleet transport key is shared and currently unencrypted at rest.** Every enrolled decoy holds
  the same symmetric key that encrypts status/threat/learn-sync traffic on the mesh - this is what
  lets nodes talk to each other and the Vigil at all, and it's a different key from the CONTROL
  signing key above. No flash/NVS encryption is configured on any board, so a physically recovered
  decoy's key is recoverable with `esptool read_flash`. **Revoke a lost or captured board immediately**
  (fleet roster → REVOKE) - this rotates the whole fleet onto a new key and re-enrolls the survivors,
  cutting the compromised board out. Until you do, treat a missing decoy as a live risk to the mesh's
  confidentiality, not just a lost board.
- **Structure-only learning.** Real-world captures are stripped to skeletons; no bystander identities
  or names are stored or emitted.
- **Measured, not assumed.** A host-side audit suite compiles the *real* generator and scores how
  separable the decoys are from a real crowd across every axis an adversary could use - address type,
  advertising interval, vendor mix, AD structure, presence/lifespan, and RSSI - turning "are the
  decoys convincing?" into a single regression-gate number instead of a hope.

## Hardware

- **ESP32-C5** (Ward) - the suggested/primary decoy board. Dual-band Wi-Fi 6, and it takes and
  charges its own LiPo battery.
- **ESP32-C6** (Shade) - fully supported alternative decoy, leaner and lower-power for
  everyday-carry.
- **ESP32** "Cheap Yellow Display" (ILI9341 + XPT2046 touch + microSD) for Vigil.

## Build & flash

### Flash from your browser - no toolchain (starter fleet)

The fastest way to try Simulacra:

### **→ [em3ritus.github.io/simulacra](https://em3ritus.github.io/simulacra/)**

Open it in desktop **Chrome or Edge**, plug in a board, click **Connect & Flash** - the
**browser web-flasher** (ESP Web Tools / Web Serial) auto-detects the chip and installs the right
role (C5 → Ward, C6 → Shade, ESP32 → CYD), no ESP-IDF and no command line. It installs the
**baked starter** regime (shared public key), so it's for trying Simulacra out, not a private
deployment. Source and self-host notes: [`web/`](web/).

### Build from source (full / provisioned regime)

Requires [ESP-IDF](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/) - v5.5 for the C5 decoy,
v5.4 for the C6 decoy and the Vigil (classic ESP32). With the IDF environment active:

```sh
# Decoy (Ward / Shade) - from the repo root
idf.py set-target esp32c5          # or esp32c6 for Shade
idf.py -DSIMULACRA_ESPNOW=1 -DSIMULACRA_CONFIG_CTRL=1 -DSIMULACRA_FLEET_PROVISION=1 build
idf.py -p <PORT> flash monitor

# Vigil controller - from ./cyd
cd cyd
idf.py set-target esp32
idf.py -DSIMULACRA_CONFIG_CTRL=1 -DSIMULACRA_FLEET_PROVISION=1 build
idf.py -p <PORT> flash monitor
```

Build-time gates (`-D…=1`) select each node's role and optional subsystems (fleet control,
enrollment, self-test). See `docs/` for design specs and per-feature notes.

**Fleet-key regime must match across the whole fleet.** With `-DSIMULACRA_FLEET_PROVISION=1`
(shown above) the Vigil mints a random fleet key at first boot and grants it to decoys through
enrollment - so decoys need the flag too, or they fall back to the baked compile-time key, never
receive the grant, and stay invisible to the controller even while healthy. To run the simpler
baked-key regime instead, omit `-DSIMULACRA_FLEET_PROVISION=1` from **every** node (all then share
the key in `components/simulacra_radar/radar_key.h`). Changing any `-D…` flag needs a clean build
(`rm -rf build sdkconfig`) so the old define doesn't linger.

**Rotate the CONTROL signing key before real use.** `-DSIMULACRA_CONFIG_CTRL=1` (shown above) is a
separate keypair from the fleet-transport key: whoever holds it can sign presets and CLEAR THREATS
commands for every node trusting the matching public key. The committed placeholder bytes
(`cyd/main/sim_ctrl_sk.h.example`) are **public knowledge** - they're in this repo's git history -
so a fleet left on them has no real control-plane authentication. Regenerate before deploying
anything you care about:

```sh
python tools/gen_ctrl_key.py       # rewrites the secret + public key headers
```

then rebuild and reflash **every** board together (decoys bake the new public key, the Vigil the new
secret) - a half-rotated fleet stops verifying.

## Offline & bench tools

Simulacra's host tools compile the **real firmware code** (not reimplementations), so behaviour is
verified against the same source that runs on-device:

- **`tools/pcap_learn/`** - replay a BLE capture (`.pcap` or `.pcapng`) through the actual
  self-learning pipeline (validate structure-only learning, emit a seed library) and the tracker
  matcher with dwell/co-travel analysis.
- **`tools/decoy_audit/`** - compile the real BLE generator on the host and score how separable the
  synthetic crowd is from a real capture, as a ranked scorecard plus a single regression-gate number.
- **`tools/probe_audit/`** - byte-exact verification that the Wi-Fi probe frames match real-phone
  archetypes, and that directed-SSID probes only ever name generic **public** networks from a fixed
  compiled-in pool - never one sourced from observed or local traffic.
- **`tools/radar_audit/`** - compiles the Vigil console's own render/control/fleet-status code on the
  host, so every screen (radar, node/threat detail, INFO console, CONTROL presets) and the fleet
  aggregation logic (stale-node pruning, threat dedup, live-vs-pending preset) are verified against
  the exact source that runs on the CYD.
- **`tools/seq_gate/`** - a two-board post-flash gate confirming each fake phone keeps its own
  802.11 sequence counter after an IDF/toolchain bump.

Each tool has its own README with build and run steps.

## Recent updates

Newest first - full history in [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md). Forward-looking milestones live in
[`docs/ROADMAP.md`](docs/ROADMAP.md).

- **Project wiki.** A full [CYD console guide + reference](https://github.com/Em3ritus/simulacra/wiki)
  (every screen, setting, preset, and status word explained) and a project-wide glossary, published
  and linked from the README.
- **TURBO flood mode.** A sixth console preset for field use, not realism: trigger it fleet-wide
  (two-tap confirm) and every board independently maxes its own BLE + Wi-Fi churn - no room-density
  matching, no persona coupling - burning through as much identifier space as the hardware sustains.
  Hardware-verified at both full 3-node-fleet and single-standalone-board (K=1) scale with zero radio
  TX errors.
- **Vigil console, fully fleshed out.** The touch dashboard became a real operator console: a
  **per-node telemetry page**, a **per-threat detail card**, a two-page **INFO** system/fleet console
  with a colour/posture **legend**, **live-vs-pending preset** state (flags a `MIXED` fleet), and a
  signed, two-tap **CLEAR THREATS** control.
- **Browser web-flasher - [live](https://em3ritus.github.io/simulacra/).** Flash a starter fleet
  from a web page - ESP Web Tools over Web Serial, auto-detecting the board and installing the right
  role. A CI action builds the three firmwares and deploys the flasher to GitHub Pages on every
  firmware change, so no binaries ever live in git.
