// therefore needs a crowd of 2N. Room-density matching flexes the UNBOUND half (beacons, tags,
// wearables); it must not squeeze out the personas themselves, which are a design constant of the
// node, not a property of the room.

// this board's ceiling and ignore the room. TURBO is HIGH's device count without the realism --
// personas released, max churn (coexist_set_turbo owns that, bypassing floor/ceiling entirely).
//
// ORDINALS ARE A WIRE CONTRACT (config_wire.h, CONFIG_WIRE_VER 2). Changing the order silently
