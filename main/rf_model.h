// and vendor_histogram (0.002-0.089) stay closed across every capture tested. AD structure was the
// exception: pick_no_mfg_template() hardcoded ~62% flags-only / ~24% flags+uuid16, fitted in
// 2026-07-13 to a single capture where flags-only advertisers were 52.7% of devices. Cross-
// validation on 2026-08-25 measured that same share at 6.7% and 0.0% in two other stationary
// captures, and ad_structure scored 0.153 on the capture it was tuned to against 0.27-0.93 on
// unseen ones -- the worst number on the scorecard, and the only axis the model could not express.

// needs their relative weight. Finer buckets would not change a single decision.
